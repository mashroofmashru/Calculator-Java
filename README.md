# Calculator-Java
This is a README file for a GitHub repository that contains a calculator code using Java language with the help of Swing framework. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It has a simple graphical user interface that allows the user to enter numbers and operators using buttons.

To run the code, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/. You also need to have Swing framework, which is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC). Swing framework provides a set of GUI components that are compatible with different platforms. You can find more information about Swing framework at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/.

To compile the code, you can use the command javac Calculator.java in the terminal or command prompt. This will create a file named Calculator.class in the same directory. To execute the code, you can use the command java Calculator in the terminal or command prompt. This will launch the calculator application in a new window. You can then use the calculator as you wish.
